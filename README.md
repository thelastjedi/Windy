Windy is an iOS widget that uses your location to show the speed and direction of the local wind. Based on the speed, we check where the wind falls on the Beaufort Scale and animate a pinwheel accordingly. The speed of the pinwheel is in no way 100% accurate, but an approximate simulation.

The project uses [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/api).
